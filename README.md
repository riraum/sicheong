> Go project to learn ([CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)).

# Background
Before, focused on the basics in Go and wrote a Hackernews CLI.
Had also done basic, static sites, with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Now, a simple CRUD project, in Go.

Wrote some basic CSS rules and for the rest used Pico CSS framework.
Instead a lot of time was used to learn about authentication and deployment.

Authentication should has quite some room for improvement, but deployment feels alright.

Researched usage of an ORM or SQL query builder such as GORM, ent, sqlc, sqlx, sqirrel and the likes.
Experiemented with GORM a bit, but reverted to pure SQL queries as it seemed to both make it easier and harder.

Also considered using PostgreSQL, instead of SQLite, as that's what "real projects" do. Instead decided to double down on SQLite and learn how to make it work.
Deployed the database on 2 persistent volumes on fly.io. Not yet done, but could be periodically saved to S3like storage.
Some posts that helped make that decision:

For deployment on fly.io
- use their CLI
- create 2 persistent volumes for a persistent sqlite database, mount them as `litefs` folder
- read their guides for LiteFS and deployment in general
- can use the repos `fly-deploy.yml`, `fly.toml`, `litefs.yml` and `Dockerfile` to see what you have to adjust
